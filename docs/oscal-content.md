# **üìö** oscal-content: Your Central Hub for Compliance

This repository is your go-to place for managing and storing security compliance content in the Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) format. Our primary focus is on Red Hat (RH) products.

## üöÄ Overview: Automated Content Sync

Initialized by [complyscribe](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://github.com/complytime/complyscribe%5D\(https://github.com/complytime/complyscribe\)), this repository features powerful GitHub Actions designed for seamless content synchronization:

* `sync-comp`: ‚û°Ô∏è Consumes data from upstream [ComplianceAsCode/content](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content%5D\(https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content\)) to generate related OSCAL content.  
* `sync-controls`: ‚û°Ô∏è Also consumes data from upstream [ComplianceAsCode/content](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content%5D\(https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content\)) to generate OSCAL content.  
* `sync-oscal-cac`: ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Syncs OSCAL content updates *back* to [ComplianceAsCode/content](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content%5D\(https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content\)). It works in tandem with [ComplianceAsCode/content's sync-cac-oscal CI](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/blob/master/.github/workflows/sync-cac-oscal.yml%5D\(https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/blob/master/.github/workflows/sync-cac-oscal.yml\)).

üîÑ Bidirectional Sync: sync-oscal-cac and sync-cac-oscal create a powerful two-way synchronization, ensuring both projects stay updated with each other's content changes.

## üîÑ How Content Synchronization Works

‚ö†Ô∏è Heads Up\! These CI systems are currently in active development. We're refining the user experience based on ongoing feedback.

### From ComplianceAsCode to OSCAL (sync-cac-oscal Workflow)

This workflow transforms content from ComplianceAsCode/content into the OSCAL format, powered by the complyscribe CLI.

* **Detect Changes:** Identifies updates in source content (controls, profiles, rules, vars).  
* **Prepare:** Gathers necessary arguments for Complyscribe.  
* **Transform:** Runs complyscribe to convert source files into OSCAL.  
* **Propose Updates:** Automatically creates a Pull Request (PR) with the new OSCAL content for review.

**Example:** A merge in ComplianceAsCode/content ([PR \#13580](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/pull/13580)) triggered a successful [workflow run](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/actions/runs/15688668981/job/44198205023), which then created an oscal-content [PR \#28](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/oscal-content/pull/28) to sync changes.

### From OSCAL to ComplianceAsCode (sync-oscal-cac Workflow)

This workflow handles the reverse sync, reflecting OSCAL content updates back into the ComplianceAsCode/content repository.

* **Trigger:** Activated upon merging a PR with OSCAL file changes.  
* **Detect Updates:** Identifies updated OSCAL files (catalogs, profiles, component-definitions).  
* **Sync with ComplyScribe:** Calls Complyscribe to transform OSCAL updates back into standard control and product profile formats.  
* **Create Upstream PR:** Automatically creates a new PR in the ComplianceAsCode/content repository.

**Example:** oscal-content [PR \#33](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/oscal-content/pull/33) triggered a successful [workflow run](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/oscal-content/actions/runs/15841883094/job/44656004616), which generated ComplianceAsCode/content [PR \#13617](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content/pull/13617) to contribute changes back.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tooling

We utilize [ComplyScribe](https://www.google.com/search?q=%5Bhttps://github.com/complytime/complyscribe%5D\(https://github.com/complytime/complyscribe\)) to help author and manage OSCAL content, ensuring adherence to required standards and formats.

### Why you should review `ComplianceAsCode/oscal-content`

The `ComplianceAsCode/oscal-content`repository is the same concept as your own `oscal-content-demo` repository. That repository will eventually be maintained by Compliance Managers.

## ü§ù Contributing

Maintainers can contribute by authoring or editing OSCAL content files in a forked repository and opening a Pull Request. Once merged, the sync-oscal-cac workflow will automatically trigger.
