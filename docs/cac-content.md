# 🛡️ ComplianceAsCode Content
The `ComplianceAsCode/content` project is an **open-source initiative** focused on simplifying and maintaining security content for various operating systems and applications.

Its core purpose is to **develop and provide security policy content** in a highly efficient manner.

## 💡 What is "Compliance as Code"?
Compliance as Code means treating your security policies and compliance artifacts like software code. This allows for automation, version control, and consistent application.

### The Problem it Solves: Redundancy
Traditionally, security content had to be developed separately for many different formats. This project combats that by establishing a **"write-once" policy** for security content.

### The Solution: A Powerful Build System
The "meat" of ComplianceAsCode is its robust build system. It enables content to be written once (using an **OpenControl-inspired YAML format**) and then automatically generated into multiple common security automation formats.

This approach leads to:
- **Efficient Development:** Reduces redundant effort across organizations.
- **Diverse Deployment:** Supports various environments and tools.

## 🎯 Key Capabilities
The `ComplianceAsCode/content` project provides executable content designed to:
- **Evaluate Compliance:** ✅ Check if a system complies with defined security baselines.
- **Remediate Non-Compliance:** 🛠️ Automatically configure a system to enforce and satisfy compliance requirements.

### How it Helps Compliance Managers
- **Streamlined Auditing:** Aids the auditing process through standardized reporting and automated evidence provisioning.

## 🔍 Deep Dive: The YAML Rule Files
The input for this powerful system consists of YAML Rule Files, inspired by OpenControl's "write-once" philosophy.
- **Templating:** Reduces boilerplate and redundancies.
- **Centralized Security Identifiers:** Ensures consistency across all generated outputs by sourcing identifiers like NIST ID and STIG from the YAML rule files.
