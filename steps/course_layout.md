## Course Layout

The ComplyTime module course leveraged the GitHub Actions automated capabilities. The course itself has two steps that are expanded upon as the course progresses.

To ensure the GitHub Actions automation will work properly, once the GitHub issue is opened in your copy of `creme-brulee` make sure that you write a comment on the issue. 

#### Example :speech_balloon:

##### Refresh page once you've made your copy of the `creme-brulee` repository.

##### Click "Go to Exercise." You'll be in the body of the GitHub issue that outlines _Step 1: Read the Docs_

> The issue should be named _Exercise: Read the docs üìö_

Welcome to the ComplyTime learning course\! This guide will help you navigate the course, which is built on GitHub Skills and uses automated workflows to set up your personalized workspace. You'll use GitHub Issues to keep track of your notes as you progress.

### **Step 1: Dive into the `creme-brulee` Course Documentation**

The very first step in your ComplyTime journey is to thoroughly review the provided `creme-brulee` course documentation. These materials are essential for understanding the project and setting the stage for the rest of your learning.

#### **Mandatory Review Materials**

Make sure you read through all the documents listed below. They are foundational to your success in this course:

| Topic                          | Where to find the Docs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

#### **Taking Notes**

As you go through the documentation, it's highly recommended that you take detailed notes. Your personal workspace, created by the automated workflows, allows you to use GitHub Issues for this purpose.

* To document your notes, create a new GitHub Issue.  
* **Important:** When creating your issue, make sure to select the "**Learning course issue template**." This will help you keep your notes organized and consistent.  
* You can refer to [this example](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/configuring-issues/quickstart) for guidance on how to create an issue.

### **Step 2: Take the Self-Assessment**

Once you've confidently reviewed all the documentation and taken your notes, it's time to test your understanding.

* Complete the short [self-assessment](https://form.typeform.com/to/tiOAik8G). This will help solidify your knowledge and prepare you for the next stages of the course.

Good luck with your ComplyTime learning journey\!

Going back to homepage to create a new branch

<img alt="img.png" height="200" src="images/gotohome.png" width="220"/>

Branches before. Click "View All Branches." The branch `main` should be the only branch in your workspace. Click on the green button in the top right corner that says "New Branch." 

<img alt="img_1.png" height="200" src="images/branchesviewbefore.png" width="210"/>

only main branch

<img alt="img.png" height="200" src="images/singlemainbranch.png" width="220"/>

Create a new branch named "learn-complytime/step-2"
> This step is _crucial_ for the course to work. Ensure you create the branch name exactly as `learn-complytime/step-2`.

<img alt="img_1.png" height="210" src="images/learn-complytimebranchname.png" width="290"/>

Click "Create new branch." The default "Source" will be the main branch. That means that the main branch will be copied to your new `learn-complytime/step-2` branch. 

>Make sure you are now on the `learn-complytime/step-2` branch.

**BEFORE**: `main` branch

<img alt="img.png" height="200" src="images/mainbranch.png" width="300"/>

**AFTER**: `learn-complytime/step-2` branch

<img alt="img_1.png" height="200" src="images/newbranchimage.png" width="300"/>

Navigate to the `markdown` folder. There should be several folders `catalogs`, `profiles`, and `component-definitions`. 

You will make edits in some of the content in the markdown folder.

<img alt="img.png" height="190" src="images/markdwon.png" width="380"/>


Clicking on Profiles there will be RHEL8, RHEL9, and RHEL10 content initialized by `complyscribe`. The folders are organized by `product-profile-level`. 

<img alt="img.png" height="190" src="images/exampleimage.png" width="380"/>

Example Markdown for RHEL10 ANSSI Control R1: Hardware Support.

[Control R1 in PDF format](https://cyber.gouv.fr/sites/default/files/document/linux_configuration-en-v2.pdf)

<img alt="img.png" height="105" src="images/frompdf.png" width="400"/>

Markdown version of Control R1 from `rhel10-anssi-enhanced` OSCAL Profile.

<img alt="img.png" height="200" src="images/profcontrolstmt.png" width="300"/>

Updates can be made to the Control Statement editable content by clicking the pencil in the top right corner of the `r1.md` file. This is where you must make sure that the branch selected in the top left corner is `learn-complytime/step-2`.


<img alt="img.png" height="190" src="images/editprofilemd.png" width="280"/>

This is the step where your knowledge from the Intro to GitHub Skills and Communicate Using Markdown will be important. The "Edit" and "Preview" tabs in the GitHub UI editor will help you check your Markdown work as you go. "Edit" is the Markdown formatted text. "Preview" is the styled format with Markdown applied.

EDIT - Markdown format that includes my change "Control my_addition_name" and "Part example new part."

<img alt="img.png" height="190" src="images/exedit2.png" width="300"/>


PREVIEW - styled Markdown format that includes my change "Control my_addition_name" and "Part example new part."

<img alt="img.png" height="200" src="images/reeditformat.png" width="270"/>


After making a few edits click the green button in the top right corner "Commit Changes." There will be a pop-up window that includes a field for your commit message and the extended description. The description can be left blank or expand on the changes you made to the Markdown. 

> Ensure the "Commit directly to the learn-complytime/step-2 branch" option is selected.

<img alt="img.png" height="220" src="images/fixupdates.png" width="320"/>

Click the green box that says "Commit Changes." Then, click **Code** in the top left corner to go back to the homepage of your repository. There will be a yellow banner that notifies you that your  `learn-complytime/step-2` branch had recent pushes. Click the green box "Compare & pull request."

<img alt="img.png" height="200" src="images/PRalert.png" width="350"/>

Once you click "Compare & pull request" there will be a new screen populated to create your pull request. Ensure that the gray banner indicates `base: main` and `compare: learn-complytime/step-2` for the pull request. This will compare your change to control R1: Hardware Support that you made on the `learn-complytime/step-2` branch to the `main` branch which was prior to editing the `r1.md` control statement.

<img alt="img.png" height="200" src="images/prcompare.png" width="300"/>


The same rules apply for the Add a description box of the Pull Request. The "Write" tab will show the Markdown format. The "Preview" tab shows the styled Markdown format.

<img alt="img.png" src="images/PRformatted.png" width="300" height="190"/>

Update the description with the issue that you opened for taking notes on the course content. Easily link the issue by using the `#` symbol. The Pull Request has a template so you can easily use bullet points, check boxes, and link references in Markdown. 

Click the green "Create pull request" button. This will create a pull request that proposes changes to the `main` branch. Your commit(s) will be shown in the pull request history.

<img alt="img.png" height="250" src="images/createprbutton.png" width="250"/>

Result

<img alt="img.png" height="190" src="images/hwoitlooks.png" width="290"/>


Click "Commits." The commit message you chose when editing R1: Hardware Support in `r1.md` should match the commit title in your pull request. Clicking on the commit will let you see the changes you made and any description you added.

<img alt="img.png" height="230" src="images/commitimage.png" width="350"/>


See here for preview of commit

<img alt="img.png" height="260" src="images/fixedcommitpreview.png" width="370"/>

Once you have opened the PR your GitHub Issue for the course will close. Switching back to the main branch, the page will send a Congratulations :tada: and you can keep practicing or reaccess your previous work on the GitHub issue by clicking "RETURN TO EXERCISE."

<img alt="img.png" height="200" src="images/congrats.png" width="280"/>

Clicking "RETURN TO EXERCISE" will bring you back to this page. Feel free to keep practicing.
